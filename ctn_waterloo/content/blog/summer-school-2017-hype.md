The CNRG lab is gearing up for this year's Nengo Summer School (AKA Brain Camp). This is an intensive two-week project-based workshop that brings researchers from around the globe together to learn about and build neural models with Nengo. The activities begin on June 4th, 2017. A sample from last year's event can be seen in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-o-MJJY7ss).
