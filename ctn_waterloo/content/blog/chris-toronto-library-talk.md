Chris recently paid a visit to the
[Toronto Public Library](http://tpl.ca/),
where he talked about recent advances in modeling the connection between biology and cognition using 
the semantic pointer architecture, and Spaun in particular.  

This was the inaugural lecture for the Krembil Foundation Cutting Edge series, focused on health
and technology.  Chris' talk, as well as the interview and audience questions, can be [seen in full here](http://tpl.ca/cuttingedge/).
