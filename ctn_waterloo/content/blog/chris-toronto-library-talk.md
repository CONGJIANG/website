Chris recently paid a visit to the
[Toronto Public Library](http://tpl.ca/),
where he talked recent advances in modeling the connection between biology and cognition.  
This was the inaugural lecture for the Krembil Foundation Cutting Edge series, focussed on health
and technology.  The talk can be seen in full [here](http://tpl.ca/cuttingedge/)
