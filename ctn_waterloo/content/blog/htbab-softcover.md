On June 1, 2015, nearly two years after its initial release,
[*How to Build a Brain*](http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0190262125/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=)
will be available in paperback for $40 ([50 CAD](http://www.amazon.ca/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Biological/dp/0190262125/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1431367751)).
To celebrate, here are some of our favorite pieces of feedback
we've received on the book, the research described in the book,
and presentations we've given on that research.

> My company's CEO told me about this book. I'm almost through my
> first reading, and it is...humbling. This book contains more
> information in fewer pages than any other book I have read on the
> subject. It's an academic text, but it is good if you are hard core
> enough to read it.
