I managed to get the price reduced somewhat, but still not to where I was
hoping. I don't think I can get it any lower. You can now
[preorder the book at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-
Architecture-Architectures/dp/0199794545/). I have been told that purchasing
through Oxford directly, or using one of their flyers at a conference should
get you a 20% savings.
