Paul Thagard, Professor of Philosophy at UWaterloo
and fellow member of the
[Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca/),
wrote a blog post
calling the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA)
a new synthesis in cognitive science,
bringing together symbolicist and connectionist approaches.
He writes:

> As in connectionism, semantic pointers are patterns of firing in
> large neural populations, but Eliasmith has figured out how to make
> them also work like symbols in high-level reasoning.  ... SPA
> provides a detailed, neurologically plausible, and mathematically
> rigorous account of how the dynamics of embodiment, embedding, and
> action work.
