The inaugural cohort is 92 top faculty members from across Canada. Chris is a pioneering figure in the rapidly developing field of <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-theoretical-neuroscience/">theoretical neuroscience</a>. His most visible contribution has been in the development of <a href="http://nengo.ca/build-a-brain/spaunvideos">Spaun</a>, the world’s largest functional model of the brain. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/stories/spaun-offers-rare-window-workings-human-brain-0">Spaun</a> has garnered wide acclaim, both in the academy and in the popular press.
