Eleven members of the CNRG were in Berlin
recently for the 35th meeting of the Cognitive Science Society.
Now that Spaun has been published,
we're branching out in several domains
to make the next generation of Spaun
even more impressive.

[Xuan Choo](/people/xuan-choo.html) presented
a new general instruction following task
that can be done by Spaun
and other models
using the Semantic Pointer Architecture.

[Slides](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/publications/choo.2013.presentation.pptx)]

[Terry Stewart](/people/terrence-c-stewart.html)
presented a poster which described
a new, more general way to
communicate with Spaun.

[Poster](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/publications/stewart.2013.poster.pdf)]

[Eric Hunsberger](/people/eric-hunsberger.html)
presented improvements to Spaun's vision system,
and applied it to image categorization,
matching human performance in two well-known tasks.

[Aziz Hurzook](/people/aziz-hurzook.html)
and [Oliver Trujillo](/people/oliver-trujillo.html)
presented a poster describing a novel
model that can process motion in the visual field,
and make decisions based on that motion.

[Poster](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/publications/hurzook.2013.pdf)]

[Trevor Bekolay](/people/trevor-bekolay.html)
presented improvements to how Spaun learns,
and showed that this learning mechanism could
be how something like Spaun might develop.
[[Paper](http://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0058/paper0058.pdf),
[Slides](http://bekolay.org/cogsci2013-pres/)]

[Peter Blouw](/people/peter-blouw.html)
presented a poster describing
a simple way to encode large vocabularies in order to
extract semantic meaning of words
that can be readily implemented
in a neural model like Spaun.
[[Paper](http://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0353/paper0353.pdf),
[Poster](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/publications/blouw.2013.poster.pptx)]

[Eric Crawford](/people/eric-crawford.html)
presented a method to encode
human-scale knowledge
(e.g., the words that would be used
in Peter's work)
in a tiny amount of simulated cortex.
[[Paper](http://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0099/paper0099.pdf),

And last but not least,
[Daniel Rasmussen](/people/daniel-rasmussen.html)
presented a poster describing
a model that solves reinforcement learning
tasks with unknown time delays
with spiking neurons.
[[Paper](http://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0580/paper0580.pdf),
[Poster](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/publications/rasmussen.2013b.poster.pdf)]

Not only did we have nine
papers accepted,
four CNRG members also received
generous travel awards.
Eric Hunsberger and Daniel
received EUCog travel awards,
and Trevor and Xuan received
AI Journal travel awards.
Congratulations to all!

But that's not all!
Our fearless leader
[Chris Eliasmith](/people/chris-eliasmith.html)
and Terry spent the whole first day of the conference
giving a tutorial on [Nengo](http://nengo.ca),
the software that we use to make large-scale neural models.
[[Writeup](http://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2013/papers/0011/paper0011.pdf)]

Berlin was a lot of fun,
and we're looking forward
to attending Cognitive Science 2014
in Quebec City next July!
