Chris recently paid a visit to the
[Waterloo Institute for Complexity and Innovation](http://wici.ca/new/2013/07/chris-eliasmith/),
where he talked about the complexities
of large-scale brain models.
It's a great talk if you're curious about
what we do at the CNRG
and want more detail than Chris's 10-minute
TEDx talk.
