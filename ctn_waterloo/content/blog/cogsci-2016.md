An excellent turnout this year from the CNRG at the 38th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society.

[Ivana Kajic](/people/ivana-kajic) presented an approach towards cognitively realistic representations of word associations using the Remote Associates Task.

[Peter Blouw](/people/peter-bluow) presented a scalable model of action planning capable of performing the correct sequence of actions in a simulated environment to solve a particular task.

[Sean Aubin](/people/sean-aubin) gave a presentation on a model of mathematical development (from a counting based strategy for addition to a recall based strategy) replicating human data in terms of accuracy and reaction times. This paper also received the [prize](https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2016/pdfs/section0004.pdf) for best applied cognition paper. Congratulations!

[Sugandha Sharma](/people/sugandha-sharma) presented a poster for a model of context dependent decision making in the prefrontal cortex. The model closely matched both behavioural and neural data obtained from monkeys performing a context sensitive perceptual decision making task.
