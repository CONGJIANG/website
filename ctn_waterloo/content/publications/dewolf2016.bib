  abstract={We present a spiking neuron model of the motor cortices and cerebellum of
the motor control system. The model consists of anatomically organized
spiking neurons encompassing premotor, primary motor, and cerebellar
cortices. The model proposes novel neural computations within these
areas to control a nonlinear three-link arm model that can adapt to unknown
changes in arm dynamics and kinematic structure. We demonstrate the
mathematical stability of both forms of adaptation, suggesting that this is
a robust approach for common biological problems of changing body size
(e.g. during growth), and unexpected dynamic perturbations (e.g. when
moving through different media, such as water or mud). To demonstrate
the plausibility of the proposed neural mechanisms, we show that the
model accounts for data across 19 studies of the motor control system.
These data include a mix of behavioural and neural spiking activity, across
subjects performing adaptive and static tasks. Given this proposed characterization
of the biological processes involved in motor control of the arm,
we provide several experimentally testable predictions that distinguish our
model from previous work.}
