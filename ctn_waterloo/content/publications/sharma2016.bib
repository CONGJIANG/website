  abstract = "Abstract The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) and Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) provide the theoretical underpinnings of the neural simulation environment Nengo. Nengo has recently been used to build Spaun, a state-of-the-art, large-scale neural model that performs motor, perceptual, and cognitive functions with spiking neurons (Eliasmith et al., 2012). In this tutorial we take the reader through the steps needed to create two simpler, illustrative cognitive models. The purpose of this tutorial is to simultaneously introduce the reader to the \{SPA\} and its implementation in Nengo. "
