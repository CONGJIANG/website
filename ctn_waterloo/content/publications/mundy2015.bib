  abstract = {By building and simulating neural systems we hope
to understand how the brain may work and use this knowledge
to build neural and cognitive systems to tackle engineering problems. The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) is a hypothesis
about how such systems may be constructed and has recently
been used to build the world’s first functional brain model,
Spaun. However, while the NEF simplifies the design of neural
networks, simulating them using standard computer hardware
is still computationally expensive – often running far slower
than biological real-time and scaling very poorly: problems
the SpiNNaker neuromorphic simulator was designed to solve.
In this paper we (1) argue that employing the same model
of computation used for simulating general purpose spiking
neural networks on SpiNNaker for NEF models results in suboptimal use of the architecture, and (2) provide and evaluate an
alternative simulation scheme which overcomes the memory and
compute challenges posed by the NEF. This proposed method uses
factored weight matrices to reduce memory usage by around 90%
and, in some cases, simulate 2000 neurons on a processing core
-- double the SpiNNaker architectural target.},
