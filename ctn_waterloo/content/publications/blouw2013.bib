  abstract = {Distributed models of lexical semantics increasingly
incorporate information about word order. One influential
method for encoding this information into high-dimensional
spaces uses convolution to bind together vectors to form
representations of numerous n-grams that a target word is a
part of. The computational complexity of this method has led
to the development of an alternative that uses random
permutation to perform order-sensitive vector combinations.
We describe a simplified form of order encoding with
convolution that yields comparable performance to earlier
models, and we discuss considerations of neural
implementation that favor the use of the proposed encoding.
We conclude that this new encoding method is a more
neurally plausible alternative than its predecessors.},
