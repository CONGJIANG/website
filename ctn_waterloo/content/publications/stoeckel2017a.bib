  abstract = {In the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), individual neuron tuning curves are often characterized in terms of a maximum firing rate and an $x$-intercept. However, for LIF neurons with conductance-based synapses it is not immediately clear how maximum rate and $x$-intercept should be mapped to excitatory and inhibitory conductance input functions $g_\mathrm{E}(x)$, $g_\mathrm{I}(x)$. In this technical report we describe a method for deriving such functions and compare the resulting conductance-based tuning curves to current-based tuning curves with equivalent parameters. For large maximum rate and $x$-intercepts the conductance-based tuning curves possess a significantly steeper spike-rate onset compared to their current-based counterparts.},
