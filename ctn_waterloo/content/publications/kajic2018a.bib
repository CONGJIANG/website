  abstract = {The representation of semantic knowledge poses a central modelling decision in
many models of cognitive phenomena. However, not all such representations
reflect properties observed in human semantic networks. Here, we evaluate the
psychological plausibility of two distributional semantic models widely used
in natural language processing: word2vec and GloVe. We use these models to
construct directed and undirected semantic networks and compare them to
networks of human association norms using a set of graph-theoretic analyses.
Our results show that all such networks display small-world characteristics,
while only undirected networks show similar degree distributions to those in
the human semantic network. Directed networks also exhibit a hierarchical
organization that is reminiscent of the human semantic network.},
