  abstract={Models of neural systems often use idealized inputs and out-
puts, but there is also much to learn by forcing a neural model to inter-
act with a complex simulated or physical environment. Unfortunately,
sophisticated interactions require models of large neural systems, which
are difficult to run in real time. We have prototyped a system that can
simulate efficient surrogate models of a wide range of neural circuits in
real time, with a field programmable gate array (FPGA). The scale of
the simulations is increased by avoiding simulation of individual neu-
rons, and instead simulating approximations of the collective activity of
groups of neurons. The system can approximate roughly a million spiking
neurons in a wide range of configurations},
