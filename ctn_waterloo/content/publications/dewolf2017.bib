  abstract={We present a trajectory generating circuit using efficient function
    representation coding in a spiking neural network that can generate
    multiple complex trajectories dynamically from a single network.
    Integrating multiple trajectories within a single network allows us to
    explore the transitions between movements. We suggest that this kind of
    network is a possible mechanism for efficiently storing a wide array of
    movement features in the cortex, and compare our results to experimental data.}
