  abstract={Living organisms are capable of autonomously
adapting to dynamically changing environments by receiving
inputs from highly specialized sensory organs and elaborating
them on the same parallel, power-efficient neural substrate.
In this paper we present a prototype for a comprehensive
integrated platform that allows replicating principles of neural
information processing in real-time. Our system consists of (a)
an autonomous mobile robotic platform, (b) on-board actuators
and multiple (neuromorphic) sensors, and (c) the SpiNNaker
computing system, a configurable neural architecture for exploration
of parallel, brain-inspired models. The simulation
of neurally inspired perception and reasoning algorithms is
performed in real-time by distributed, low-power, low-latency
event-driven computing nodes, which can be flexibly configured
using C or specialized neural languages such as PyNN
and Nengo. We conclude by demonstrating the platform in
two experimental scenarios, exhibiting real-world closed loop
behavior consisting of environmental perception, reasoning and
execution of adequate motor actions.},
