  abstract={Production and comprehension of speech are closely
    interwoven. For example, the ability to detect an
    error in one's own speech, halt speech production,
    and finally correct the error can be explained by
    assuming an inner speech loop which continuously
    compares the word representations induced by
    production to those induced by perception at various
    cognitive levels (e.g. conceptual, word, or
    phonological levels). Because spontaneous speech
    errors are relatively rare, a picture naming and
    halt paradigm can be used to evoke them. In this
    paradigm, picture presentation (target word
    initiation) is followed by an auditory stop signal
    (distractor word) for halting speech production. The
    current study seeks to understand the neural
    mechanisms governing self-detection of speech errors
    by developing a biologically inspired neural model
    of the inner speech loop. The neural model is based
    on the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) and
    consists of a network of about 500,000 spiking
    neurons. In the first experiment we induce simulated
    speech errors semantically and phonologically. In
    the second experiment, we simulate a picture naming
    and halt task. Target-distractor word pairs were
    balanced with respect to variation of phonological
    and semantic similarity. The results of the first
    experiment show that speech errors are successfully
    detected by a monitoring component in the inner
    speech loop. The results of the second experiment
    show that the model correctly reproduces human
    behavioral data on the picture naming and halt
    task. In particular, the halting rate in the
    production of target words was lower for
    phonologically similar words than for semantically
    similar or fully dissimilar distractor words. We
    thus conclude that the neural architecture proposed
    here to model the inner speech loop reflects
    important interactions in production and perception
    at phonological and semantic levels.}
