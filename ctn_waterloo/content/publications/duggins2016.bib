  abstract = {The ability to improve in speed and accuracy as a result of repeating some task is an important hallmark of intelligent biological systems. We model the progression from a counting-based strategy for addition to a recall-based strategy. The model consists of two networks working in parallel: a slower basal ganglia loop, and a faster cortical network. The slow network methodically computes the count from one digit given another, corresponding to the addition of two digits, while the fast network gradually "memorizes" the output from the slow network. The faster network eventually learns how to add the same digits that initially drove the behaviour of the slower network. Performance of this model is demonstrated by simulating a fully spiking neural network that includes basal ganglia, thalamus and various cortical areas.}

  abstract = {Our ongoing investigations into biologically plausible syntactic and semantic parsing have identified a novel methodology for processing complex structured information.  This approach combines Vector Symbolic Architectures (a method for representing sentence structures as distributed vectors), the Neural Engineering Framework (a method for organizing biologically realistic neurons to approximate algorithms), and constraint-based parsing (a method for creating dynamic systems that converge to correct parsings).  Here, we present some of our initial findings that show the promise of this approach for explaining the complex, flexible, and scalable parsing abilities found in humans.},
