  abstract={Concepts are widely agreed to be the basic constituents of thought. Amongst philosophers
and psychologists, however, the question of how concepts are structured has been a
longstanding problem and a locus of disagreement. I draw on recent work describing how
representational content is ascribed to populations of neurons to develop a novel solution
to this problem.
Because disputes over the structure of concepts often reflect divergent explanatory
goals, I begin by arguing for a set of six criteria that a good theory ought to accommodate.
These criteria address philosophical concerns related to content, reference, scope,
publicity, and compositionality, and psychological concerns related to categorization
phenomena and neural plausibility.
Next, I evaluate a number of existing theoretical approaches in relation to these six
criteria. I consider classical views that identify concepts with definitions, similarity-based
views that identify concepts with prototypes or exemplars, theory-based views that
identify concepts with explanatory schemas, and atomistic views that identify concepts
with unstructured mental symbols that enter into law-like relations with their referents. I
conclude that none of these accounts can satisfactorily accommodate all of the criteria.
I then describe the theory of representational content that I employ to motivate a
novel account of concept structure. I briefly defend this theory against competitors, and I
describe how it can be scaled from the level of basic perceptual representations to the
level of highly complex conceptual representations. On the basis of this description, I
contend that concepts are structured dynamically through sets of transformations of single
source representation, and that the content of a given concept specifies the set of potential
transformations it can enter into. I conclude by demonstrating that the ability of this
account to meet all of the criteria introduced beforehand. I consider objections to my
views throughout.},
