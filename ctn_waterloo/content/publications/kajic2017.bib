ABSTRACT={Generating associations is important for cognitive tasks including language
acquisition and creative problem solving. It remains an open question how the
brain represents and processes associations. The Remote Associates Test (RAT)
is a task, originally used in creativity research, that is heavily dependent
on generating associations in a search for the solutions to individual RAT
problems. In this work we present a model that solves the test. Compared to
earlier modeling work on the RAT, our hybrid (i.e. non-developmental) model is
implemented in a spiking neural network by means of the Neural Engineering
Framework (NEF), demonstrating that it is possible for spiking neurons to be
organized to store the employed representations and to manipulate them. In
particular, the model shows that distributed representations can support
sophisticated linguistic processing.  The model was validated on human
behavioral data including the typical length of response sequences and
similarity relationships in produced responses. These data suggest two
cognitive processes that are involved in solving the RAT: one process
generates potential responses and a second process filters the responses.}
