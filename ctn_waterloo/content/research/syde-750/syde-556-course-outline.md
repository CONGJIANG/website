_Course Title_: Simulating Neurobiological Systems (SYDE 556/750 topic 8)

_Instructor_: Chris Eliasmith ([celiasmith@uwaterloo.ca](mailto:celiasmith@uwaterloo.ca), HH 331)

_Room and Time_: E5 6127, Mon & Thurs. 12:30p-1:50p (2:00p-2:50p Thurs for 750)

_Texts_: Eliasmith and Anderson (2003). Neural Engineering: Representation, Computation
and Dynamics in Neurobiological Systems. MIT Press.

_Homepage_: http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/research/syde-750.html

_Course Description_: This course examines a general framework for modeling
computation by neurobiological systems with an emphasis on quantitative
formulations. Particular emphasis will be placed on understanding computation,
representation, and dynamics in such systems. Students will learn how the
fundamentals of signal processing, control theory and statistical inference,
can be applied to modeling sensory, motor, and cognitive systems.

_Prerequisites:_ Knowing how to program using matrices in some language (e.g. Python, MATLAB) is highly recommended.  Familiarity with calculus and linear algebra is required.

_Discussion Forum:_ You can sign up [on piazza.com](https://piazza.com/) to talk about the assignments, etc.:

**_Grading_**: The course requires four assignments (60%) and a final project (40%). Assignments are due electronically by _Midnight_ of the due date. Late assignments lose 1 mark per day. Assignments are to be done individually (everyone writes their own code and answers questions themselves).

_Academic Integrity:_ In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity,
members of the University of Waterloo are expected to promote honesty, trust,
fairness, respect and responsibility.

_Discipline:_ A student is expected to know what constitutes academic
integrity, to avoid committing academic offences, and to take responsibility
for his/her actions. A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an
offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g.,
plagiarism, cheating) or about "rules" for group work/collaboration should
seek guidance from the course professor, academic advisor, or the
Undergraduate Associate Dean. When misconduct has been found to have occurred,
disciplinary penalties will be imposed under Policy 71 - Student Discipline.
For information on categories of offenses and types of penalties, students
should refer to [Policy 71 - Student Discipline](http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm)

_Grievance_: A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of
his/her university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for
initiating a grievance. Read [Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4](http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm)

_Appeals_: A student may appeal the finding and/or penalty in a decision made
under Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances (other than regarding a
petition) or Policy 71 - Student Discipline if a ground for an appeal can be
established. Read [Policy 72 - Student Appeals](http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm)

_Accommodation for Students with Disabilities:_ The Office for Persons with
Disabilities (OPD), located in Needles Hall, Room 1132, collaborates with all
academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with
disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If
you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability,
please register with the OPD at the beginning of each academic term.
