title: A Selective History of Visual Attention Presentation

Here is a presentation by John Tsotsos (York University), titled "A Selective
History of Visual Attention". **Summary: ** "Recent years have seen a renewed
interest in the study of visual attention. This tutorial aims to present the
state of the art in the computational modeling of visual attention. Starting
from the biology of the primate visual system, we will show how various
aspects of visual attention have been addressed in the computational modeling
literature, and conclude with a more detailed discussion of a number of recent
applications. The half day tutorial covers a broad range of topics from the
basics of primate visual function to applications of visual attention in
computer vision. Most of the major paradigms and issues in selective attention
research are discussed in a systematic way."
