intro: Important information we often refer to when modelling.
people:
    - Chris Eliasmith
toc:
    - Membrane time constant (tau_rc)
    - Neurotransmitter Time Constants (PSCs)
    - Non Linear Pyramidal Cells
    - Number of Inhibitory Interneurons
    - Spike Rates
    - Typical Number of Inputs

We attempt to match our models to the properties of actual neurons. This set of pages is meant to collect important information about actual neurons, along with relevant citations.
