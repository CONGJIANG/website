title: Statistical inference

The NEF book proposes a general method for performing statistical inference in
spiking neural networks.

We also rely heavily on more standard machine learning methods that employ
statistical inference in our [object recognition](/?q=node/12) research.

## Normalization

Like other methods, the important step of normalization of the probability
density functions that are represented in our neural implementation is left to
other mechanisms. Recently we have been working on methods to include
normalization in the inference transformation (which takes place in the
connection weights). We have recently submitted this work for publication. The
supporting Nengo and Matlab code can be downloaded
[here](/files/published_code.zip).
