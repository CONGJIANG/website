title: Reviews

**Mark D. Humphries** (Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, UK),
*Connection Science*

"[T]he book impresses. The writing must be praised for its clarity and
well-structured approach to all the topics discussed, as must the
excellent use of figures to illuminate even the most difficult points.
Moreover, the reader’s interest is maintained
throughout by the coherent way in which the material is presented:
individual chapters of mathematically dense works such as this often
read like appended papers; happily this is not the case here.
Most importantly, the authors successfully demonstrate the utility
of their general modelling framework."

**Allen Selverston** (Institute for Nonlinear Science, University of California,
San Diego, La Jolla, California), *Quarterly Review of Biology*

"[Eliasmith and Anderson] apply these principles in terms of
systems description, design specification, and implementation, and use this
tripartite structure to consider a wide range of sensory and motor systems.
Along the way, they describe most of the mathematical tools used by
computational neuroscientists in a clear and concise way.
All of these ideas are lucidly presented in this well-written volume.
It will serve as a superb textbook, but only for anyone with an extensive
background in mathematics."

**Michael Paulin** (Department of Zoology and Centre for Neuroscience,
University of Otago, New Zealand ), *Neural Networks*

"[Eliasmith and Anderson are] people who like to actually build stuff that
actually works – [the book] is a welcome counterpoint to the main competitor
in this game, unconstrained. speculation ... the kind of work that
Eliasmith and Anderson are doing is essential."

**Peter Erdi** (Center for Complex Systems Studies, Department of Physics,
Department of Psychology, Kalamazoo College, Michigan),
*IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks*

"[T]he book provides a good summary of problems of neural representation
and transformation from the perspective of engineering,
by which neurobiologists can learn about their mathematical methods.
I would recommend it to anyone who would like to learn more about the field."
