title: Multidimensional representation

What does it look like to represent a high-dimensional vector using neurons?
Here is a video of 2500 neurons representing a 25-dimensional vector. The
vector is shown as an image at the top of the screen, but the vector being
represented does not need to be an image. The shading of the neurons indicates
their membrane voltage: the start white, then become darker as the voltage
builds up. Eventually, they fire (yellow), resetting their voltage back to the
beginning. We have organized the neurons so that ones with similar preferred
direction vectors are near each other.
