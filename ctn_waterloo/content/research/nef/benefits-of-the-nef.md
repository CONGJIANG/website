title: Benefits of the NEF

**General theoretical benefits:**

  * captures neural representation of arbitrarily complex objects (i.e. scalars, vectors, functions, vector fields, etc.)
  * captures linear and nonlinear neural computations
  * captures arbitrary neural dynamics (linear, nonlinear, time-varying, adaptive, etc.)
  * unifies population and temporal coding
  * quantitatively specified

**Neural modelling benefits:**

  * analytically determines connection weights for models (this can be reversed; i.e. given weights, high-level transformations can be extracted)
  * incorporates any available neural data (e.g., tuning curves, response functions, trasmitter/receptor types, anatomical constraints, etc.)
  * appropriate regardless of single cell model (i.e. rate, spiking, full conductance based)
  * arbitrary network topologies
  * complexity of models is smoothly variable (i.e. single cells, population level, systems level)
  * learning is not need to construct informative models, but can be included as desired
  * means to test abstract hypotheses about neural function
  * relates directly to recorded neural data (e.g. spikes, tuning curves, pooled spikes, fMRI signals (i.e. filtered spiking activity), LFP, EEG, etc.)

**Simulation benefits:**

  * easily scales complexity to allow match to available hardware
  * no learning is necessary (though allowed), permitting rapid model development
  * GUI simulator freely available, with full scripting ([Nengo](http://www.nengo.ca/))
