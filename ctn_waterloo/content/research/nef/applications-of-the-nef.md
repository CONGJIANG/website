title: Applications of the NEF

The NEF has been used to construct models of

  * a wide variety of cognitive models (Eliasmith, 2012, How to Build a Brain, Oxford)
  * parametric working memory (Eliasmith & Anderson, 2001)
  * translational vestibular ocular reflex in monkeys (Eliasmith, Westover, & Anderson, 2002)
  * barn owl auditory system (Fischer, 2005)
  * the rodent navigation system (path integration; Conklin & Eliasmith, 2005)
  * escape and swimming control in zebrafish (Kuo & Eliasmith, 2005)
  * somatosensory working memory (Singh & Eliasmith, 2006)
  * arbitrary attractor networks (Eliasmith, 2005)
  * visuo motor transformations for reaching (DeWolf, 2008, tech report)
  * the effects of emotions on decision making (Litt et al, 2008)
  * recognition of song by zebra finch (Hurwitz, 2008, tech report)
  * language processing in humans (Eliasmith, 2004; Stewart & Eliasmith, 2009)
  * zebra finch song system (Anderson, 2009, unpublished)
