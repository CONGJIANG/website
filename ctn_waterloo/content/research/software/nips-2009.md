title: NIPS 2009

The following activities were written for the Neural Information Processing
Systems (NIPS 2009) conference for use at our demo table for Nengo. The
software for use in this tutorial can be downloaded at
[http://www.nengo.ca](http://www.nengo.ca/). This demo is available online at
http://ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca/cnrglab/node/175.

  
The videos we were running at the demo booth are posted here: [http://www.yout
ube.com/watch?v=q4jxI26gUtA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4jxI26gUtA).

  

Nengo (www.nengo.ca) is a graphical neural simulation environment. The
following are available at the booth, and on the web.
