title: Tutorials

The following tutorials are meant to provide a hands-on demonstration of the various capabilities of the software we have written. They are focussed on the Nengo simulator.

Beginners should start with the video tutorials, or the tutorials in the Nengo documentation.

The tutorials below include slides explaining some of the concepts behind the NEF, as well as how to use Nengo. The most recent of these is the CogSci 2010 tutorial.

Also, if you are adventurous, you can download various examples from the Nengo Model Archive. There may be few, if any, instructions with some of those examples.
