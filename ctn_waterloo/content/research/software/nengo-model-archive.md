title: Nengo Model Archive

Here we will post links to various Nengo models that you can download and play
with. Some are quite large files. All are zipped .nef files. You need
[Nengo](http://nengo.ca) to load and run these files.

### Motor Control

  * [Integrator](/files/Integrator.nef_.zip) - This is the integrator you construct in the [tutorial](?q=node/5). Networks like this are found in fish through mammals. This sort of network is used for controlling horizontal eye position. However very similar networks are used for many other behaviours, as discussed in this [paper](?q=node/434).

### Cognitive

  * [Working memory](/files/Code.zip) This model and [report](/files/SYDE556report.pdf) compares 1D and 2D working memory in terms of RMS and stability. Here are some cool movies referred to in the report: [spikes movie](/files/spikemovie.zip), [2000 neurons](/files/all940dim2000.zip), [40 dimensions](/files/all940dim.zip) and [20 dimensions](/files/all920dim.zip). It also incorporates methods for running function representation simulations in Nengo.

### Perception
