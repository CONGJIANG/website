title: Optimal control of simple arm model

Feel free to correct, comment, or suggest any thoughts or ideas.


Principle Investigator: Travis DeWolf;


This is a very simple implementation of a 'hierarachical' controller of a
simple linear 2d arm model. The descending command guides the arm in a
straight line to the target point, the low level controller matches the
descending command using quadratic programming. The target can be moved with
the [w,s,a,d] keys.
