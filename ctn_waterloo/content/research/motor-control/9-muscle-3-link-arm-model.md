title: 9-muscle 3-link arm model

This is a 9 muscle, 3 link arm model simulation for Matlab, developed in
MapleSim5. The muscles are an implementation of Hill's muscle model, and the
model measurements are from the paper 'On control of reaching movements for
musculo-skeletal redundant arm model' by K.Tahara et al. ![](http://ctnsrv.uwa

waterloo.ca.cnrglab/files/files/9Muscle3LinkArm.zip)to the 9-muscle 3-link arm
model, all necessary files to run in Matlab are included. The files were
compiled for a 64-bit system. To run on a 32-bit system, recompile the model
using the modelGen.m file. The model currently only runs on PCs. To run, open
the 'run' file and hit 'F5'. The number keys will activate muscles, and the
corresponding letters beneath will reset the activation level to 0. Please
contact me (Travis) if you have any questions or would like the corresponding
MapleSim files. The files are open for sharing and modification, but shout
outs are appreciated.
