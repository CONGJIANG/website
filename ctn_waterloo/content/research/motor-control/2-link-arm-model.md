title: 2 link arm models

Here are links to some of the different arm models that we've been working with, in both Python and Matlab. 

####Python simulations
Here is Python code that simulates a simple 2 link arm model. 
Additionally there is an operational space and generalized coordinates (joint-space) controller implemented. 
To read details about the implementation of the controller please refer to the robot control posts at [studywolf.wordpress.com](http://studywolf.wordpress.com/category/robotics/)

####Matlab simulations
Here is Matlab code that simulates a simple arm model. 
To add forces to the arm, you can use the keys 'q' and 'w' for the shoulder and 'o' and 'p' for the elbow. 
Should be able to just paste and run this in recent Matlab versions.
