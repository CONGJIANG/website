title: 3-link arm models

This is a 3 link arm model simulation for Matlab, developed in MapleSim5. The
model measurements are from the paper 'On control of reaching movements for
musculo-skeletal redundant arm model' by K.Tahara et al. ![](http://ctnsrv.uwa
terloo.ca/cnrglab/sites/ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca.cnrglab/files/images/3LinkArmPic.p
ng) [Here is a link](http://ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca/cnrglab/sites/ctnsrv.uwaterloo
.ca.cnrglab/files/files/3LinkArm.zip) to the 3-link arm model, all necessary
files to run in Matlab are included. The files were compiled for a 64-bit
system. To run on a 32-bit system, recompile the model using the modelGen.m
file. The model currently only runs on PCs. To run, open the 'run' file and
hit 'F5'. The number keys will activate/deactivate muscles, and the letters
beneath will reset the activation level to 0. Please contact me (Travis) if
you have any questions or would like the corresponding MapleSim files. The
files are open for sharing and modification, but shout outs are appreciated.
