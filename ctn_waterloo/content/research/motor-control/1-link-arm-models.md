title: 1 link arm models

Here are links to some of the different arm models that we've been working with, in both Python and Matlab.

####Python simulations

Here is Python code that simulates a simple 1 link arm model.
The model is generated by MapleSim and compiled down to some highly optimized C code (arm.py). To use the MapleSim simulator, download the folder and run 
"python setup.py build_ext -i".
