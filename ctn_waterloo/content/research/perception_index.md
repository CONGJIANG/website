  * [An attentional model]()

## **Visual Recognition and Processing**

Techniques inspired by biological vision are the state of the art in various
application domains

  1. SIFT, GLOH: object recognition
  2. Convolution Neural Network: handwriting digit recognition
  3. Standard model: fast feedforward detection task

We seek to use biological inspirations and hierarchical architectures to
attack the problem of achieving better recognition performance.

Specific projects currently include

  * Most feedforward visual models contain engineered or pre-built spatial arrangement, e.g. in the form of receptive fields of the complex cells. We ask if it is possible to learn these arrangements using sensory stimulus.

  * It is well known that class-specific visual data, such as face images of a person under various transformations, lies on a low dimensional manifold embedded in high dimensional space. We ask if it is possible to use hierarchical models to help find functions which project a new sensory input onto class-specific manifolds.
