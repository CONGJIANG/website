## **Motor Control**

As part of the research in our lab we are looking at biological mappings of a
hierarchical optimal control framework behind motor control in the brain.
Travis DeWolf has been working on developing a biologically plausible
framework for models of neural control of movement, to read an abbreviated
description of this model, please click here: [NOCH framework](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/NOCH.pdf).
