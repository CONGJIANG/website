## **Motor Control**

As part of the research in our lab we are looking at biological mappings of a hierarchical optimal control framework behind motor control in the brain. Travis DeWolf has been working on developing a biologically plausible framework for models of neural control of movement, to read an abbreviated description of this model, please click here: [NOCH framework](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/NOCH.pdf).
