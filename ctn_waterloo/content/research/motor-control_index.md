## Our motor projects

### Available downloads

  * [2-link arm model](motor-2link): This is a simple two-link arm model for Matlab.
  * [3-link arm model](motor-3link): This is a three-link arm model for Matlab, developed with MapleSim.
  * [6 muscle arm model](motor-6muscle):This is a 6 muscle, 3-link arm model for Matlab, developed with MapleSim.
  * [9 muscle arm model](motor-9muscle):This is a 9 muscle, 3-link arm model for Matlab, developed with MapleSim.
  * [Optimal control of linear arm model](motor-2linkopctrl): This is an example of an optimal controller for a linear arm model that implements a very basic hierarchy to guide the end-effector in a straight line to the target. The target is moved with the [w,s,a,d] keys.
  * [Simple arm control implemented in Nengo](?q=node/599): This example implements a linear controller for a nonlinear arm model in Nengo, demonstrating how to hook up to the physics engine.
  * [Neural integrator learning demo](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/cnrglab/?q=system/files/NIdemo.zip): This example requires downloading the OMS model and runs in matlab and simulink. (See the readme).

## **Motor Control**

As part of the research in our lab we are looking at biological mappings of a
hierarchical optimal control framework behind motor control in the brain.
Travis DeWolf has been working on developing a biologically plausible
framework for models of neural control of movement, to read an abbreviated
description of this model, please click here: [NOCH framework](http://ctnsrv.u
