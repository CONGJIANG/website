intro: >
  Semantic pointers are neural representations that carry 
  partial semantic content and are composable into the representational 
  structures necessary to support complex cognition. These pages describe a
  cognitive architecture based on them. This architecture has been used to build 
  the world's largest functional brain model, Spaun.

The book 'How to build a brain'
[amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0199794545/)
from Oxford University Press is
was published in Spring 2013. It exploits the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) to develop
the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) for cognitive modelling. The book provides tutorials
in [Nengo](http://nengo.ca) to explain and demonstrate many of the central concepts discussed in 
the book. Information that supports the book by providing links to models,
demos, videos, and tutorials mentioned in the book, as well as a summary of
the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) can be found on the [Nengo
website](http://nengo.ca/build-a-brain).
