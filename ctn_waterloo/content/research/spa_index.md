The book 'How to build a brain' [amazon link] from Oxford University Press is
due out in 2012. It exploits the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) to develop
the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) for cognitive modelling. The book uses
Nengo to explain and demonstrate many of the central concepts for these
frameworks. Information that supports the book by providing links to models,
demos, videos, and tutorials mentioned in the book, as well as a summary of
the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) can be found on the [Nengo
website](http://nengo.ca/build-a-brain).
