title: Questions about the brain

The point of this section is to write down any important general questions
that show up via discussion, etc. It will be marked private, since a good
question is often the most important starting point of new research.

### 1. What about those bias currents

In all of our models of single neurons, we include a bias or background
current: ` a_i = G_i[ \alpha_i <\tilde{\phi}_i x> + J^{bias}_i> ` The intent
is to include the effects of 'other currents' and provide a 'background'
firing rate. However, when not in vivo cortical cells do not have a background
firing rate. Thus, these currents are not intrinsic. If we think we have
modeled the entire system, we should have no background currents.
