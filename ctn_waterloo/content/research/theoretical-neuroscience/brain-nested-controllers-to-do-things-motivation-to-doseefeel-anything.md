title: Brain = nested controllers to do things + motivation to do/see/feel anything

Basically, there are streams of stuff (classic works, and a re-emergence in the past few years) pushing deeper into showing that what the brain 'wants' (to obtain or avoid) shapes not only motor outputs, but also things that *should* be free of such influences, i.e., things for which we should have 'true-value' goals rather than 'desired end-state' goals. This includes basic perception, e.g., people can really see what they want to see,

And also their thoughts, feelings, and perceptions about things and their effects on and for us. For instance, "wanting to like" something often makes people construe mixed, ambiguous or equivocal information about it positively (I have some studies here, plus tons of other work is out there). But motivational forces can also push actions and motor planning in conflict with pre-existing (or otherwise manipulated) cognitions; this is why we can feel compelled to do things we'll regret, even if we know we'll regret them, or can 'want' something we won't 'like'. Neurally speaking, there's converging evidence from Kent Berridge's lab, Bechara, Bush, Zink, Brian Knutson, and some of my own stuff with Antonio Rangel that you can tease apart dissociable (but not disjoint) sub-systems related more to cognitive/emotional appraisal, versus motivational vigour and action planning/motor output.

From a modeling perspective, to the extent that using control theory is really the way to go for capturing goal orientation in how the brain works (i.e., as providing a means to both specify and achieve 'desired' states, and avoid undesirable ones), *and* given that one can really model every damn thing in the brain using nested/hierarchical controllers (Chris, I think you and I discussed this once with Mark Churchland, and maybe Lloyd?), I think someone could use the NEF to basically nail down all these "whole-brain", cross- and inter-systemic effects of motivation, and come up with a really integrative framework for how motivational forces dissociably and synergistically shape and warp basic perception, feelings/thoughts, and impulses/desires/motor planning/actual actions. This would be a nice step towards understanding how brains operate on their own in the environment to construct sharp and opinionated 'worldviews' and preferences, and thus actually settle on, choose, and plan specific motor outputs (and not others), without the modeler-as-god telling it what it likes, what it should see, or what it should do, or using input signals that are basically designed to do the same. This seems related to how HRRs were used in the Wason Task paper and the follow-up application Paul and I did to abductive hypothesis-generation and inference (only way cooler).

This would be better than all the robotics stuff on just straight goal-directed behavior, which tend to work in (highly rigid) practice mainly by omitting all the fun representational and guts stuff that might actually be of primary interest to some (i.e., me).
