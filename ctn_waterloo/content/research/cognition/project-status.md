title: Project Status

## To do:

  * fix cleanup memory

## Progress:

**23/06/11** -wrapped things up for publication

  * fix figure solver (run model with more dimensions)
  * get results for complete RAPM
  * analyze performance as model degrades (modelling aging)

**15/08/10** - thesis complete
**11/10/09** - haven't updated this in a while, all the to-do's are now complete:

  * test model on more complex matrices
  * develop system that handles abstract rules
  * develop system that can fetch desired matrix data (rather than simply providing it as function input)
  * come up with a more formal system to represent matrices as HRRs

**14/07/09** - cleanup memory integrated into model
**19/05/09** - model now working with spiking neurons
**01/05/09** - completed report on "proof of concept" model
