  * Rat Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons (Schwindt et al., 1997):
    -M
inimum Steady Firing Rate: 10 +- 0.4Hz (5-16 Hz)

    -M
aximum Steady Firing Rate: 74Hz (6.7+-0.4 x minimum rate)

> The parameters for the LIF neuron models are as follows: membrane time
constant τ RC = 10 ms; refractory period τref = 1 ms; peak firing rates over
the represented range are chosen from a uniform distribution over 200 to 400
Hz. Inhibitory interneurons are similarly modeled, except that their firing
saturates at a higher rate: between 500 and 700 Hz (Azouz et al., 1997).
