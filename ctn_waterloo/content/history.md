title: History

The Computational Neuroscience Research Group (CNRG) was started in 1992
by [Charles H. Anderson](/people/charles-h-anderson.html) when he moved with
David Van Essen to [Washington University](http://medicine.wustl.edu/).
In 2001, [Chris Eliasmith](people/chris-eliasmith.html), then a member of
the Washington University group moved to the University of Waterloo and
began a second CNRG. The two groups were closely affiliated and employ
the same [approach](/research/nef.html). The CNRG began by
constructing models of the visual system, introducing the cortical
shifter circuit. Concurrently, the CNRG pursued work on the probability
density function (PDF) framework for neural representation. Although
that framework has now been considerably extended and improved, the main
goal of providing a unifying framework for understanding complex
neurobiological systems remains the same (see
[research](/research.html)).

Upon the retirement of [Charles H. Anderson](/people/charles-h-anderson.html) in 2005 or so,
[Chris Eliasmith](people/chris-eliasmith.html) became the
sole lab head and is located at Waterloo. The CNRG at Waterloo is part of
Waterloo's [Centre for Theoretical
Neuroscience](http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca/) (CTN), which Dr. Eliasmith directs. For seminars, workshops,
and other activities related to theoretical neuroscience, please visit
the [Centre's webpage](http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca/).

Funding for the CNRG (WashU) has been provided by the [National Science
Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/) and the Center for Higher Brain
Function. Major funding for the CNRG has been provided by the G. Harold
and Leila Y. Mathers Foundation of Mt. Kisco, N.Y. Funding for the CNRG
(Waterloo) has been provided by the [Natural Sciences and Engineering
Research Council](http://www.nserc.ca/) (NSERC) of Canada, the [Canadian
Foundation for Innovation](http://www.innovation.ca), the [Ontario
Innovation Trust](http://www.oit.on.ca/), and [Canada Research Chairs](http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx)
among others.
