James Bergstra is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Waterloo

working in the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience under Chris Eliasmith. His

research has focused by turns on visual system models and learning algorithms,

hyperparameter optimization, high performance computing, and music

information retrieval. He moved to the University of Waterloo from Harvard

University where he worked for a year in David Cox's Computer and Biological

Vision lab. He completed doctoral studies at the University of Montreal in

July 2011 under the direction of Professor Yoshua Bengio with a dissertation

on how to incorporate complex cells into deep learning models. In the course

of his graduate work he co-developed Theano, an open source optimizing

compiler that can make use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for

high-performance computation. He completed a Masters in 2006 under the

direction of Douglas Eck on algorithms for classifying recorded music by

genre.
