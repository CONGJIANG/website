James Bergstra is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Waterloo
working in the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience under Chris Eliasmith. His
research has focused by turns on visual system models and learning algorithms,
hyperparameter optimization, high performance computing, and music
information retrieval. He moved to the University of Waterloo from Harvard
University where he worked for a year in David Cox's Computer and Biological
Vision lab. He completed doctoral studies at the University of Montreal in
July 2011 under the direction of Professor Yoshua Bengio with a dissertation
on how to incorporate complex cells into deep learning models. In the course
of his graduate work he co-developed Theano, an open source optimizing
compiler that can make use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for
high-performance computation. He completed a Masters in 2006 under the
direction of Douglas Eck on algorithms for classifying recorded music by
genre.
