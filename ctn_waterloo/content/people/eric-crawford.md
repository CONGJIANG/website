I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at the CNRG. My interests
include machine learning, neural coding, and neural computation in general. I
am particularly interested in neural implementations of Bayesian inference,
for giving neural agents the ability to represent and manage uncertainty in
the world. Does the brain represent probability distributions, and if so, how?
How do these distributions relate to each other? What architectures allow
priors to be efficiently updated using data coming from the world, and how are
these architectures constrained by neurophysiological data?

  
In 2012 I graduated from the University of Waterloo's BMATH(CS) Co-op program
with the Cognitive Science option. I spent 3 of my co-op terms at the CNRG
where I worked on parallel implementations of neural networks. I wrote a GPU
implementation for Nengo, our software based on the Neural Engineering
Framework, permitting hundreds of thousands of neurons to be simulated in
parallel.
