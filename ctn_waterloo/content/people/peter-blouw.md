Bio:

  
I am a PhD student in the UW Department of Philosophy. I received my BA in
English Literature from the University of Guelph (2010), and my MA in
philosophy from the University of Waterloo (2011).

  
Research:

  
My research in the CNRG focuses primarily on theories of concepts and lexical
semantics. I知 currently working on a corpus linguistics project that compares
different methods for encoding word order information into holographic
representations, and I am also developing some ideas regarding
compositionality in vector-symbolic architectures. The long-term goal of my
research is to better understand concepts through the development of models of
conceptual processing that satisfy constraints ranging from the behavioral to
the neurobiological.

  
I知 also interested in theories of mental representation, the
semantics/pragmatics distinction, and natural language processing. My general
philosophical interests encompass the areas of mind, language, and logic.
