Dr. Anderson received his Ph.D. in 1962 from Harvard University after which he began a 25 year career with RCA labs. At RCA, he was involved in the development of next-generation visual displays (flat panel). Dr. Anderson then moved to Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where he worked in the Sensing & Perception Research Group. In 1992, he joined the Dept. of Anatomy and Neurobiology at Washington University. His recent work focused on computational models of complex neural systems, culminating in the framework presented here.

Dr. Anderson has authored over a hundred papers in physics and vision science, and has received 24 patents. His patents have stemmed from a number of projects including the invention of a spectrometer for acoustic radiation in the frequency range of 20 to 300 GHz which he used to make the most precise measurement of the van der Waals force, and the first direct measurement of the anomalous dispersion of the velocity of sound in liquid helium. In addition, he invented a large flat television display based on periodic electrostatic focusing and led a team effort that demonstrated its technical feasibility. More recently, he assembled a real time multi-resolution image system for the JPL Mars Rover.
