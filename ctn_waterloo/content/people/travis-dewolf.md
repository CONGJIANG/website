I'm a PhD student in Systems Design Engineering here at University of
Waterloo, researching the motor control system in the brain. To see some of
the things I've been thinking about recently you can check out my blog here:
[http://studywolf.wordpress.com](http://studywolf.wordpress.com)

I received my Master's degree (MMath) in Computer Science at Waterloo (2010),
with my thesis, "NOCH: A biologically plausible framework for models of neural
motor control."

My undergraduate degree was in Computer Science (BCSH), received from Acadia
University (2007), with my thesis "The algebraic properties of Template Guided
DNA Recombination theory."

  

# Research interests

  
My goal is to develop a formal mathematical model capturing the function and
interaction of the neurobiological subsystems involved in motor control. This
has lead me down a number of different interesting paths.

  
** Control theory **   
Optimal feedback control - E Todorov

Hierarchical / operational-space control systems - O Khatib, E Todorov

KL controllers and compositionality of movement - E Todorov

Model predictive control - Y Tassa, T Erez, E Todorov

Dynamic motor primitives - S Schaal, J Peters, A Ijspeert

  
** Motor learning **   
Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) - E Theordorou, S Schaal

Policy iteration for adaptive optimal control - D Vrabie, FL Lewis

Learning operational space control - J Peters, S Schaal

Locally weighted projection regression - S Vijayakumar, S Schaal

  
** Computational Neuroscience **   
Basal ganglia models - F Ashby, K Gurney, J Prescott, P Regrave, R Turner

Cerebellum models - O Coenen, D Wolpert, C Boucheny, M Kawato, R Miall, K
Doya, A Bastian

Motor cortex models

Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) - C Eliasmith, C Anderson

Spike timing dependent plasticity - G Bi, M poo, E Izhikevich

  
These are some of the topics that I've researched. I focus on learning current
control theoretic techniques, and investigating analogous methods and
implementations in the brain. This involves heavy research into the neural
architecture and structure of the motor control system, exploring the
plausibility of biological systems carrying out the described processes, and
investigating alternative methods.

  
I have been building a framework for biologically plausible models of neural
motor control, unique in its scope, called the Neural Optimal Control
Hierarchy (NOCH) framework. To read an abbreviated, and recent, description of
the NOCH framework, which is constantly under development, please click here:
