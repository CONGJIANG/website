I'm a PhD student in Systems Design Engineering here at University of
Waterloo, researching the motor control system in the brain. To see some of
the things I've been thinking about recently you can check out my blog here:

** Education ** 

I received my Master's degree (MMath) in Computer Science at Waterloo (2010),
with my thesis: 
[NOCH: A biologically plausible framework for models of neural motor control](http://www.uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/10012/4949/1/main.pdf).

My undergraduate degree was in Computer Science (BCSH), received from Acadia
University (2007), with my thesis: The algebraic properties of Template Guided
DNA Recombination theory.

** Research interests **

My goal is to develop a formal mathematical model capturing the function and
interaction of the neurobiological subsystems involved in motor control. The 
focus of my PhD is to build a spiking neuron level model of motor learning 
across the basal ganglia, motor cortex, and cerebellum. This involves research 
into the neural architecture of the motor control system, exploring the
plausibility of various machine learning methods, and investigating 
biologically realistic alternatives.

I have been building a framework for biologically plausible models of neural
motor control, called the Neural Optimal Control Hierarchy (NOCH). 
To read an abbreviated, and recent, description of
the NOCH framework, which is constantly under development, please click here:
