I am currently pursuing my MASc in the Systems Design Engineering department.
I also completed my undergrad (BASc in Systems Design) at UW, where I rounded
out my technical courses with an option in Cognitive Science.

  
My main area of research is the human visual system, which I model using
restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), a type of neural net pioneered by the
machine learning community. RBMs can be arranged hierarchically要ery similar to
visual cortex葉o allow for the accurate recognition of various types of
objects, including handwritten digits. One of my goals is to rework these
mathematical models to work in simulated neurons, creating a biologically
plausible model of visual cortex. I am also working to incorporate attention
into my models, allowing for spatial- and scale-invariant recognition of
objects.
