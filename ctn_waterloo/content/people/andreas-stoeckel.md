I am interested in a broad range of topics including ‒ but not limited to ‒ neuromorphic
hardware, neurorobotics, and unsupervised learning strategies. While I haven’t decided
on a topic for my PhD yet, I’m currently focusing on extending the Neural Engineering
Framework to more detailed neuron models and efficient coding schemes.

Prior to joining the CNRG in January 2017 I’ve been a research assistant at the
[Cognitronics and Sensor Systems Group](http://www.ks.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/) in Bielefeld,
Germany, working on neuromorphic hardware benchmarks and associative memory as part of the
HBP neuromorphics subproject.

In my free time I’m either reading, building free software, tinkering with electronics,
writing terrible German fantasy novels, or wandering around aimlessly and getting lost.
