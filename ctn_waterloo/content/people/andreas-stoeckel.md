I am interested in a broad range of topics including ‒ but not limited to ‒ neuromorphic
hardware, neurorobotics, and unsupervised learning strategies. While I have not decided
on a topic for my PhD yet, I am currently extending the Neural Engineering Framework
towards more detailed neuron models and efficient coding schemes.

Prior to joining the CNRG in January 2017, I have been a research assistant at the
[Cognitronics and Sensor Systems Group](http://www.ks.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/) in Bielefeld,
Germany, where I worked on neuromorphic hardware benchmarks and associative memory as part of the
[HBP neuromorphics subproject](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/sp9).

In my free time, I am either reading, building free software, tinkering with electronics,
writing terrible German fantasy novels, or wandering around aimlessly, getting lost.
