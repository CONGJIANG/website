I have joined the CNRG lab as a visiting PhD student in Computing from
Plymouth, UK. I am interested in modelling of higher cognitive functions, in
particular semantic memory and problem solving. While these topics have for
a long time been a focus of research in the field of artificial intelligence,
they have provided a limited explanation of how human intelligence works. In
order to understand what makes our human thinking similar to and yet different from
"thinking" in computers and robots, I will use spiking artificial neural
networks to simulate common problem solving and memory phenomena. 
Currently, I am using SPA and NEF to investigate associative verbal processing.

Apart from brains, computers and robots I am also interested in programming
education.
