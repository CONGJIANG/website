I joined the lab in September 2013 as a PhD student in Systems Design Engineering. I received my MSc. in Computer Science from the University of Toronto (2013), and my BSc. (Hons) in Mathematics from Dalhousie University (2011).

I am interested in brain modelling from a systems perspective, and I'm currently working on a detailed model of coordinated eye and head movement for visual search and tracking.
