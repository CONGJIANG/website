I am joining the lab for an internship. I am a second year Masters student in Neurobiology at the University of Amsterdam. I completed my bachelors of psychobiology and physics both at the University of Amsterdam. 

I will work on an anatomically and physiologically detailed model of spatial navigation in the hippocampus. The spatial information will eventually be combined with the sensory and timing information of an event to create a complete episodic memory.
