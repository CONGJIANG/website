I am currently a PhD student at the CNRG
after completing my MMath (also at the CNRG) in 2011.

My primary research interest is in learning and memory.
In my masters degree, I explored how to do
supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
in networks of biologically plausible spiking neurons.
In my PhD, I am applying this knowledge to
the domain of audition to explore
how sounds coming into the ear become complex
linguistic structures in the brain.
