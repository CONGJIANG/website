I started my MMath at the U of Waterloo in Sept, 2009. My primary research
interest is in learning and memory, specifically in how we might implement
reinforcement learning in biologically plausible networks of spiking neurons,
and what implications that has about the types of error signals we see in the
brain. I have a Bachelors in CS from the University of Manitoba. I am a
relatively prolific writer; I was the science editor for [The
Manitoban](http://www.themanitoban.com/) for a year, and am currently a staff
writer for the [How-To Geek](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/author/tbekolay/)
blog.
