## Background

  
  
I'm the lab head, and also director of the [Centre for Theoretical
Neuroscience](http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca/) (of which the CNRG is a part). I'm
jointly appointed in Philosophy and Systems Design Engineering, and cross-
appointed to Computer Science. I have supervised students in each of these
departments as well as Biology and Psychology. I did my undergrad in
Engineering (Waterloo), and my PhD in Philosophy at Washington University in
St. Louis. My first book with Charlie Anderson is called 'Neural Engineering'
(MIT Press, 2003). My second called 'How to build a brain' (Oxford University
Press) will be out in 2013.

  

## Research Interests

  
  
I'm interested in everything that is currently being worked on in the lab,
including perception, motor control, learning, and cognition in the brain. I'm
particularly interested in how all of the various aspects of the brain work in
concert to generate sophisticated, adaptive behaviour. To this end, I work on
developing mathematical and conceptual tools that allow us to rigorously test
hypotheses about the principles of neural computation and biological
cognition. I think such hypotheses need to be highly constrained by all of the
various sources of information we have about brain function (e.g.
electrophysiology, neuroanatomy, molecular biology, fMRI, behaviour, etc.). I
also think the best way to test such hypotheses is through detailed
simulation.
