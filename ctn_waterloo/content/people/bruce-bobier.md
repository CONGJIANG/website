## Research Interests

My current research primarily deals with visuospatial attention, specifically
by considering the problem as one of dynamically routing visual information
through the ventral stream. The model performs this dynamic routing via the
dendritic interaction of a subcortical control signal and feedforward
projections, resulting in a subset of the visual information being projected
to early inferotemporal cortex, while maintaining local spatial relationships
in an object-centred reference frame.
