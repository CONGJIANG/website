I am working on my MASC in experimental neuroscience under the supervision of
Dr. Eliasmith and Dr. Matt Van der Meer. I am interested in the neural
processes that underlie decision making especially with respect to rewards. My
project involves recording neural activity from the brains of rats while they
perform a reward motivated decision making task.
