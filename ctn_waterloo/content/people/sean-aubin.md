I'm starting my Masters in Systems Design Engineering in September 2015 by studying how humans learn to cognitive skills. I'm currently pursuing this in the context of the Tower of Hanoi task, while exploring other examples of human inductive reasoning.

I previously worked at the CNRG during my last co-op term translating Dan Rasmussen's HRL code from Nengo 1.4 to Nengo 2.0, with the intention of embodying it inside of a robot. I also developed a proof of concept GUI for visualising the data I was getting from the model, which then evolved (with the hard work of my lab-mates) into the current Nengo GUI.
