I started my Masters in Systems Design Engineering in September 2015 with a focus on studying how humans learn to cognitive skills. I'm currently pursuing this in the context of the Tower of Hanoi task, while exploring other examples of human inductive reasoning. The application for this research will be the Tower of Hanoi task and removing the hard-coded rules as modeled by Terry Stewart.

I previously worked at the CNRG during my last co-op term translating Dan Rasmussen's HRL code from Nengo 1.4 to Nengo 2.0, with the intention of embodying it inside of a robot. I also developed a proof of concept GUI for visualising the data I was getting from the model, which then evolved (with the hard work of my lab-mates) into the current Nengo GUI.
