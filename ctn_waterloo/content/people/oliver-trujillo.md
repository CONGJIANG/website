I am currently working on my MMath in Computer Science. I joined the CNRG in
September 2012, and previously received my BSc., also in Computer Science,
from UBC in 2007.

My research interests are in learning and representation in the brain,
particularly in how the hippocampus encodes and recalls episodic memories
and spatial maps.
