I am currently working on my MMath in Computer Science. I joined the CNRG in
September 2012, and previously received my BSc., also in Computer Science,
from UBC in 2007.

My research interests are on learning and representation in the brain,
particularly in taking existing neural network algorithms commonly employed in
machine learning and looking at how they might be implemented in the brain.
