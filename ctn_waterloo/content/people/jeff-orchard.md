I am a mathematician, computer scientist, and Associate Professor in the
Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I received
my BMath from Waterloo in 1994, my MSc in applied math from UBC in 1996, and
my PhD in computing science from SFU in 2003.

  
Though much of my research career so far has been devoted to medical image
processing, my real passion is to understand the brain and how it drives human
behaviour. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by how we perceive the world
through our senses, and use that knowledge to make decisions. How are memories
encoded? And what is consciousness? These are the big questions I want answers
to. I use computer simulations of neural networks, and mathematical models in
an effort to unravel these mysteries.
