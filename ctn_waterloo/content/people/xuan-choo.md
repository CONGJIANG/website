## Bio

I am an PhD (CS) student here at UWaterloo. In 2001 I graduated from UBC with
a BASc in Computer Engineering. While I was there, I worked with VLSI cad
design and robotics. One cool project I worked on was a remote surgical device
with force feedback capabilities. I have a couple of years of working
experience, where I worked as the head of the IT department for a company that
deals with providing accurate and realistic real-time battlefield simulation
for the military. The core of the system involved a sophisticated laser
engagement system (similar in concept to laser tag), and this is coupled with
a real-time location and status tracking system.

For my Master's project, I designed a spiking neuron model that modelled human serial
working memory that replicated typical human recall behaviours like primacy and recency
(remembering items at the start and end of a list better than the middle of the list).

Between my Master's and PhD programs, I worked on integrating various models built by 
other members of the lab into one gigantic model called Spaun. 


## My Research Interests

I have a rather wide set of research interests.

### Memory (Working & Long-term)

How does the brain remember things, and what sorts of representations are used
to do so. How does the brain integrate the different sensory inputs in working
memory, and what is the underlying structure? How does the brain "decide" what
to put into long-term memory and how does it do it?

### General Cognition and Large-scale Model Design

I am interested to study and model how the brain performs tasks like concept
generalization and problem solving. I am also interested in the problem of
integration - to build a system that seamlessly melds sensory input, with
decision making and problem solving, with motor output, in order to perform
highly complex tasks.

### Language Learning, Representation, and Processing

Languages come in many forms:

  * Written languages: which can be further broken down into logographic (pictorial languages, like Chinese, Japanese), and syllabic (languages like English, French, etc).
  * Spoken languages
  * Sign languages

And yet the brain is able to make sense of it all. Is there an underlying
general framework that the brain uses to represent these different forms of
languages, or does each form have its own specific framework? Additionally,
how does the brain learn languages? Are multiple sensory inputs required to
learn a language, or is just one sensory input enough?
