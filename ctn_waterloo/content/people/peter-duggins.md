**Research Synopsis:** In order for social science to become a rigorous scientific discipline, researchers must simulate and analyze artificial societies populated with psychologically plausible agents. This requires an interdisciplinary approach incorporating fields ranging from neuroscience to psychology to sociology. To develop agents with realistic cognitive, emotional, and social capacities, one must:
<ol type="a">
<li>specify how neural networks represent, transform, and respond to information,</li>
<li>construct agents *in silico* using an architecture based on these principles, and</li>
<li>train agents throughout a developmental regime. Once a population of mature agents is thus created, they can be placed in a virtual environment and allowed to interact with one another, producing artificial societies that can be controlled and analyzed to an arbitrary degree.</li>
</ol>

In my masters and doctoral work at the University of Waterloo, I plan to employ Chris Eliasmith's Semantic Pointer Architecture to these ends. Specifically, I plan to use the SPA to model and train artificially intelligent agents capable of emotionally-biased cognition and social interaction, then validate the simulation by reproducing empirical findings from social psychology. Woohoo!
