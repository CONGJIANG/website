### Research

My fundamental objective is to maximize the wellbeing of intelligences that experience subjectively positive and negative states of consciousness. To realize this goal, I simulate and analyze artificial societies populated with cognitively, emotionally, and socially plausible agents. To develop these agents, I plan to (a) specify how biological neural networks represent and process information, (b) construct agents using a principled computational architecture, and (c) train agents through a developmental regime using learning. I will then (d) place a population of agents in a virtual environment and evolve it through time, producing artificial societies. With unlimited access to information in the simulation, I can (e) define quantitative measures of an agentâ€™s wellbeing based on its observed brain state. To maximize this quantity across society, I will (f) design controlled experiments that investigate the internal and external conditions which promote the greatest wellbeing, and finally (g) apply these results back to our reality for the same purpose.

In my masters work at the University of Waterloo, I plan to model the effects of drugs on emotional systems, specifically the amygdala, using biologically detailed neuron models; this is the first step towards understanding the neuromodulatory control these systems exert over other cognitive processes. In my doctoral work, I hope to engineer agents capable of emotionally-biased cognition and social interaction through a combination of neural engineering and reinforcement learning. When these agents are fully developed, I will attempt to reproduce experiments in social psychology.
