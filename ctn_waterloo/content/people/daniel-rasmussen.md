I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Watelroo,
working with Chris Eliasmith in the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience.

## Education

I completed a Master's of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo (in the
Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience) in 2010, with my thesis 
[A neural modelling approach to investigating general intelligence]( http://hdl.handle.net/10012/5330).

I did my undergrad in Sackville, NB at Mount Allison
University. I graduated in May 2008 with a double major in Computer Science and Philosophy. 

## Research interests

I am interested in general intelligence: what is it, how does it develop, what
are its components, and how might we model it. I am particularly interested in
incorporating large scale adaptability into these models, so that we can
understand how they come to be and how they develop into the future.  This has led to 
my interest in reinforcement learning, where I seek to understand how we could
learn from experience to build up the complex processing of intelligence.

## Current projects

Building neural models capable of hierarchical reinforcement learning

## Past projects

Modelling problem solving in Raven's Progressive Matrices
