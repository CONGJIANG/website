## Bio

From Calgary originally, I did my undergrad in Sackville, NB at Mount Allison
University. I majored in Computer Science and Philosophy, graduating in May
2008. I completed my Master's at the CTN in August 2010, and am now working
towards a PhD.

## Research Interests

I am interested in general intelligence: what is it, how does it develop, what
are its components, and how might we model it. I am particularly interested in
incorporating large scale adaptability into these models, so that we can
understand how they come to be and how they develop into the future.

## Current Projects

Modelling problem solving in Raven's Progressive Matrices
