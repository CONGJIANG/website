I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo,
working with Chris Eliasmith in the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience.
You can find my [full CV here](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/files/people/danielrasmussen/CV.pdf).

## Education

I completed a Master's of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo (in the
Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience) in 2010, with my thesis 
[A neural modelling approach to investigating general intelligence](http://hdl.handle.net/10012/5330).

Prior to that I completed my undergrad at Mount Allison
University in Sackville, NB. I graduated in 2008 with a double major in Computer Science and Philosophy. 

## Research interests

I am interested in general intelligence: what is it, how does it develop, what
are its components, and how might we model it. I am particularly interested in
incorporating large scale adaptability into these models, so that we can
understand how they come to be and how they develop into the future.  This has led to 
my interest in reinforcement learning, where I seek to understand how we could
learn from experience to build up the complex processing of intelligence.

## Current projects

Building neural models capable of hierarchical reinforcement learning

Here is a brief, high-level presentation I gave describing this research:
